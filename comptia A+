# üì± Mobile Networks Cheat Sheet (CompTIA A+)

## üß© Cellular Basics
- Mobile = "cellular" = divided into **cells**.
- Each cell has antennas to maintain **signal coverage** while moving.

---

## üì∂ 2G Networks
- Early networks focused on **voice**, not data.
- Two standards:
  - **GSM** ‚Äì Global System for Mobile Communications
  - **CDMA** ‚Äì Code Division Multiple Access
- Originally **circuit-switched**, later upgraded for data.
  
---

## üåç GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)
- ~90% of early global mobile market.
- Popular in Europe, AT&T, and T-Mobile (USA).
- Uses **SIM cards** to store user data (easy to swap phones).
- Uses **multiplexing** (time-division): multiple users share same frequency.

---

## üîê CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)
- Each call uses a unique **code** for communication.
- Popular in the US: Verizon & Sprint.
- No SIM cards; phones were **locked to the network**.
- Not widely adopted outside the US.

---

## üöÄ 3G (Introduced in 1998)
- **Faster speeds**, better support for:
  - GPS
  - Streaming video & audio
  - Video calls
- Speeds: a few **Mbps** (megabits per second)

---

## ‚ö° LTE / 4G (Long Term Evolution)
- Unified GSM and CDMA into a **single global standard**.
- Based on **GSM + EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates)**.
- Speeds:
  - LTE: Up to **150 Mbps**
  - LTE-A (Advanced): Up to **300 Mbps**

---

## üöÄ 5G (Introduced ~2020)
- **Massive speed boost**: up to **10 Gbps**
- Real-world speeds: 100‚Äì900 Mbps
- Enables:
  - Advanced **IoT** (Internet of Things)
  - Fast **cloud uploads**
  - High-quality **real-time streaming**

---

## üõ† PRL (Preferred Roaming List)
- Tells your phone which towers/networks to connect to.
- Updated via **OTA (Over-The-Air)** updates.

---

## üåê Hotspot / Tethering
- Turns phone into **Wi-Fi router** using 802.11 + cellular data.
- Some providers charge extra or limit functionality.
- Useful for sharing internet with other devices.

## üìå Summary Table

| Topic      | Key Points |
|------------|------------|
| **Cellular** | Antennas + cells = mobile coverage |
| **2G**       | GSM/CDMA, voice-focused |
| **GSM**      | Global, SIM cards, time multiplexing |
| **CDMA**     | Code-based, US-only, locked phones |
| **3G**       | GPS, streaming, several Mbps |
| **4G/LTE**   | Unified standard, 150‚Äì300 Mbps |
| **5G**       | 10 Gbps max, IoT, ultra-fast |
| **PRL**      | OTA roaming updates |
| **Hotspot**  | Phone as Wi-Fi router (may cost extra) |

---

## üîç Good Terms to Google
- Circuit switching vs packet switching  
- Multiplexing (time vs frequency division)  
- GSM vs CDMA technical differences  
- LTE-A vs LTE  
- mmWave 5G vs sub-6 GHz
